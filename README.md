# üî• Machine Learning & Remote Sensing for Wildfire and Spatial Risk Management

Welcome to the workshop repository! This collection of Jupyter notebooks and spatial data supports the training on using **machine learning and remote sensing** for **wildfire detection, monitoring**, and **spatial risk assessment**.

The content is structured to guide participants through downloading remote sensing data, applying ML models, and using patch-based processing approaches for large spatial datasets.

## üìö Workshop Structure

### 1. üì• **Data Download**
- Learn how to access and organize satellite imagery (e.g. MODIS, Sentinel).
- Automated scripts and notebooks to download and format data for modeling.

### 2. ü§ñ **Machine Learning Models**
- Supervised learning: Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression
- Burned area classification and fire risk prediction
- Model evaluation  
- Use  model to classify new images 

### 3. üß© **Patch-Based Analysis**
- Divide satellite images into small "patches" for training
- Use Convolution based model and attention mechanism
